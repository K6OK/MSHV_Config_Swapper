Program allows the user to store and load up to 6 different MSHV 
configurations. Each saved configuration includes all of the settings in effect when 
saved.

**INSTALL.**  Run Swapper. Click Setup. Follow the instructions: Step 1 creates the 
storage folders on your drive (in {USER}\AppData\Local). Step 2 asks you to 
show Swapper where your MSHV folder is.

**SAVE A CONFIG.** In MSHV, set all desired options. In Swapper, select Configuration, 
write a short description into one of the 6 memory slots.  Click Save.

**LOAD A CONFIG.** Close MSHV. On the main Swapper screen, click one of the 6 
buttons to load that previously saved configuration. Restart MSHV.  Hovering your 
mouse over the button will display your description for that configuration.

NOTE: You must shut down MSHV before loading a saved configuration. 

WHY IS SWAPPER SO SMALL?  I did that on purpose because I wanted to be able 
to tuck it into a screen corner and not use up very much monitor real estate.

Tested on Windows 10 with MSHV 2.71. -- 73 gud DX!
